# DoggyMania
A Candy Crush clone with an integrated greedy algorithm capable of scanning the board for the highest scoring move before executing it.

The game can be run by executing the .jar file found in the dist folder.

Some things to mention about this project are that its GUI is unlikely to scale well, as the laptop on which I developed the project has an older graphics driver with a lower screen DPI, and that the main focus of the project itself was the accompanying algorithm I developed. As such, the visual component of the project is admittedly lacking, but the game logic and algorithm functionality are all complete.
